# NavFromScratchApp
I have studied how to use WinUI3 from a varietyof courses and sources, however looking to understand this topic better I created this simple project with the help of MSF Copilot and the official docs folliwng a step by step process so I can really understand how all the pieces are put together to create an app with pages navigation using a side navbar.  

If you are also tryning to learn this subject I much recommend the course by Thomas Claudius Hubber in Pluralsight and James Montemagno content on YouTube
